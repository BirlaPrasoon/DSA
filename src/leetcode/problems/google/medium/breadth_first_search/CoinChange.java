    Return the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.

    You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

/*    Example 1:

    Input: coins = [2], amount = 3
    Output: -1
    Example 3:

    Input: coins = [1], amount = 0
