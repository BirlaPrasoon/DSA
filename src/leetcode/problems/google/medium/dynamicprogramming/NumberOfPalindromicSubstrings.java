    // Binary Search with a fast rolling hash algorithm (like Rabin-Karp). This approach tries to optimize
    // Approach #3 by speeding up the time to figure out the largest palindrome for each of the 2Nâˆ’1 centers
    // in logarithmic time. This approach counts all palindromic substrings in O(NlogN) time. Here's a Quora answer
    // by T.V. Raziman which explains this approach well.

    // Palindromic trees (also known as EERTREE). It is a data structure invented by Mikhail Rubinchik which
    // links progressively larger palindromic substrings within a string. The tree construction takes linear time,
    // and the number of palindromic substrings can be counted while constructing the tree in O(N) time. Additionally,
    // the tree can be used to compute how many distinct palindromic substrings are in a string (it's just the number
    // of nodes in the tree) and how frequently each such palindrome occurs. This blog post does a good job of explaining
    // the construction of a palindromic tree.

    // Suffix Arrays with quick Lowest common Ancestor (LCA) lookups. This approach utilizes Ukonnen's algorithm to
    // build suffix trees for the input string and its reverse in linear time. Subsequently, quick LCA lookups can
    // be used to find maximum palindromes, which are themselves composed of smaller palindromes. This approach can produce
    // a count of all palindromic substrings in O(N) time. The original paper describes the algorithm, and this Quora answer
    // demonstrates an example.

    // Manacher's algorithm. It's basically Approach #3, on steroids.TM The algorithm reuses computations done for previous
    // palindromic centers to process new centers in sub-linear time (which reduces progressively for each new center). This
    // algorithm counts all palindromic substrings in O(N) time. This e-maxx post provides a fairly simple implementation of
    // this algorithm.
