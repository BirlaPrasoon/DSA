/*
    You are given a positive integer n representing the number of nodes of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
    The nodes are numbered from 0 to n - 1 (inclusive).

    You are also given a 2D integer array edges, where edges[i] = [fromi, toi] denotes that there is a
    unidirectional edge from fromi to toi in the graph.

    Return a list answer, where answer[i] is the list of ancestors of the ith node, sorted in ascending order.

    A node u is an ancestor of another node v if u can reach v via a set of edges.

    Constraints:

    1 <= n <= 1000
    0 <= edges.length <= min(2000, n * (n - 1) / 2)
    edges[i].length == 2
    0 <= fromi, toi <= n - 1
    fromi != toi
    There are no duplicate edges.
    The graph is directed and acyclic.

    * The problem revolves around the nature of the graph as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
    * In a DAG, cycles are absent, and each path progresses clearly from a starting point to an endpoint.
    * This characteristic implies that by processing nodes in a specific order, we can systematically determine each node's ancestors.
    * The key to identifying this optimal processing order lies in topological sorting.
    * In a DAG, topological sorting arranges nodes such that for every directed edge from node u to node v, u precedes v in the ordering.
    * This arrangement is crucial because it ensures that when we process a node v, we have already considered all its potential ancestors.
    * To achieve this ordering, we will use Kahn's algorithm.
    *
    * Kahn's algorithm is a method for topologically sorting a directed acyclic graph.
    * It starts by identifying all nodes without incoming edges and placing them in a queue.
    * At each step, it removes a node from this queue, adds it to the sorted list, and eliminates its outgoing edges from the graph.
    * This process may create new nodes without incoming edges, which are then added to the queue.
    * The algorithm continues until the queue is empty. The resulting list provides a valid topological ordering of the graph.
    * For a more detailed explanation of Kahn's algorithm and its implementation, refer to this Explore Card.
    *
    * After establishing the topological order, we process each node sequentially.
    * For each node, we iterate through its neighbors, designating both the node itself and its ancestors as ancestors of the neighbor.
    * To efficiently track each node's ancestors, we use a list of sets. Sets, unlike lists, maintain unique elements,
    * ensuring each ancestor appears only once in a node's ancestor set.
    *
    * In the final step, we'll convert these sets of ancestors into lists, as required by the problem statement.
