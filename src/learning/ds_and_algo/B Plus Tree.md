# B+ Trees

B+ trees are a type of self-balancing tree data structure that allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations. They are commonly used in database and file system implementations due to their ability to maintain sorted data and provide fast access to records.

## Key Characteristics

1. All leaf nodes are at the same level.
2. Internal nodes store only keys, while leaf nodes store both keys and data pointers (or the actual data).
3. Leaf nodes are linked together, forming a linked list for efficient range queries.
4. The root can have a minimum of two children.
5. All nodes except the root must be at least half full.
6. A non-leaf node with k keys must have k+1 children.

## Structure

- **Internal Nodes**: Contains only keys and pointers to child nodes.
- **Leaf Nodes**: Contains keys and either data pointers or the actual data.
- **Root Node**: Can be either a leaf node (if the tree is small) or an internal node.

## Operations

### 1. Search

'public Node search(int key) {
Node current = root;
while (!current.isLeaf) {
int i = 0;
while (i < current.keys.length && key > current.keys[i]) {
i++;
}
current = current.children[i];
}
for (int i = 0; i < current.keys.length; i++) {
if (current.keys[i] == key) {
return current;
}
}
return null;
}'

- Start from the root and traverse down to the leaf level.
- At each internal node, choose the appropriate child based on key comparisons.
- At the leaf level, perform a linear search for the desired key.

### 2. Insertion

'public void insert(int key, Object value) {
Node leaf = findLeafNode(key);
insertIntoLeaf(leaf, key, value);
} else {
Node newLeaf = splitLeaf(leaf, key, value);
insertIntoParent(leaf, newLeaf.keys[0], newLeaf);
}
}'

- Find the appropriate leaf node.
- If the leaf has space, insert the key-value pair.
- If the leaf is full, split it and propagate the split upwards if necessary.

### 3. Deletion

'public void delete(int key) {
Node leaf = findLeafNode(key);
int i = 0;
while (i < leaf.keys.length && leaf.keys[i] != key) {
i++;
}
if (i < leaf.keys.length) {
deleteFromLeaf(leaf, i);
} else {
System.out.println("Key not found");
}
}'

- Find the leaf containing the key.
- Remove the key-value pair.
- If the node becomes underfull, borrow from siblings or merge nodes.

## Example

Let's consider a B+ tree of order 3 (each node can have 2 to 3 keys, and 3 to 4 children). We'll insert the following keys: 3, 7, 10, 15, 18, 22, 25, 30, 35, 40.

Here's how the tree would look after these insertions:
```
                    22
                  /      \
            10, 15    30, 35
        /    |    \    |    \
        3,7 10,15 18,22 25,30 35,40
```

Explanation:
- The root node contains only one key (22) in this case.
- There are two internal nodes: 10, 15 and 30, 35.
- The leaf nodes are 3,7, 10,15, 18,22, 25,30, and 35,40.
- All leaf nodes are at the same level and would be linked together (not shown in the ASCII representation).

If we were to search for the key 18:
1. Start at the root (22).
2. 18 is less than 22, so we go to the left child 10, 15.
3. 18 is greater than 15, so we go to the right child 18,22.
4. We find 18 in this leaf node.

## Advantages

1. Maintains sorted data for efficient range queries.
2. Provides logarithmic time complexity for insert, delete, and search operations.
3. Optimized for systems that read and write large blocks of data.
4. Allows for efficient sequential access of records.

## Use Cases

- Database Management Systems (DBMS)
- File Systems
- Indexing in databases
- Implementing ordered dictionaries

B+ trees are a powerful data structure that combines the benefits of balanced trees and linked lists, making them ideal for applications that require both random access and sequential scanning of ordered data.
