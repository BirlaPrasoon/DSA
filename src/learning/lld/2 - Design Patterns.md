# Design Patterns

Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. They are best practices that can be used to solve recurring design issues and improve the flexibility and reusability of code. Design patterns are categorized into three main types: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral.

## 1. Creational Design Patterns

Creational design patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. They abstract the instantiation process, making it easier to create objects in a way that suits the specific needs of the application.

- **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
- **Builder**: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.
- **Prototype**: Creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype, which can be more efficient than creating new instances from scratch.
- **Factory Method**: Defines an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.
- **Abstract Factory**: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

## 2. Structural Design Patterns

Structural design patterns are concerned with how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures. They focus on creating a structure that is flexible and efficient while keeping the components decoupled.

- **Adapter**: Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together by converting the interface of a class into another interface that a client expects.
- **Bridge**: Separates an abstraction from its implementation, allowing the two to vary independently.
- **Composite**: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies, allowing clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
- **Decorator**: Adds responsibilities to objects dynamically, providing a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
- **Facade**: Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, making it easier to use.
- **Flyweight**: Reduces the cost of creating and manipulating a large number of similar objects by sharing common parts of the state among objects.
- **Proxy**: Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

## 3. Behavioral Design Patterns

Behavioral design patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects. They focus on communication between objects and how they interact.

- **Chain of Responsibility**: Passes a request along a chain of handlers, allowing multiple objects to handle the request without the sender knowing which object will handle it.
- **Command**: Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.
- **Interpreter**: Defines a grammatical representation for a language and provides an interpreter to interpret sentences of the language.
- **Iterator**: Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
- **Mediator**: Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact, promoting loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly.
- **Memento**: Captures and externalizes an objectâ€™s internal state without violating encapsulation, allowing the object to be restored to that state later.
- **Observer**: Defines a dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
- **State**: Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes, making the object appear to change its class.
- **Strategy**: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable, allowing the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it.
- **Template Method**: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.
- **Visitor**: Defines a new operation to a set of objects without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.

## Conclusion

Design patterns provide general reusable solutions to common problems in software design. By understanding and applying these patterns, developers can create more robust, maintainable, and scalable software systems. Each pattern offers unique benefits and can be chosen based on the specific needs of the application or system being developed.
