# Time Series Databases

Time series databases (TSDBs) are specialized database systems designed to handle time-stamped or time series data. They are optimized for collecting, storing, retrieving, and processing data points indexed in time order.

## Key Features

1. Efficient storage and retrieval of time-stamped data
2. High write performance for real-time data ingestion
3. Optimized for time-based queries and aggregations
4. Data retention policies and downsampling capabilities
5. Support for handling large volumes of data

## Use Cases

1. **IoT and Sensor Data:**
    - Collecting and analyzing data from IoT devices and sensors
    - Example: Smart home energy consumption monitoring

2. **Financial Market Data:**
    - Storing and analyzing stock prices, exchange rates, and trading volumes
    - Example: High-frequency trading analytics

3. **Application and Server Monitoring:**
    - Tracking system metrics, application performance, and user behavior
    - Example: Real-time dashboard for server CPU, memory, and network usage

4. **Industrial Telemetry:**
    - Monitoring industrial equipment and processes
    - Example: Predictive maintenance in manufacturing plants

5. **Environmental Monitoring:**
    - Tracking weather data, pollution levels, and climate changes
    - Example: Air quality monitoring in urban areas

6. **Business Intelligence:**
    - Analyzing time-based business metrics and KPIs
    - Example: Tracking sales performance over time

7. **Network Performance Monitoring:**
    - Analyzing network traffic patterns and performance metrics
    - Example: Detecting network anomalies and potential security threats

## Companies Using Time Series Databases

1. **Netflix:** Uses Atlas (their in-house TSDB) for monitoring and alerting
2. **Uber:** Utilizes M3DB for storing and querying billions of metrics
3. **CERN:** Employs InfluxDB for monitoring the Large Hadron Collider
4. **NASA:** Uses InfluxDB for monitoring spacecraft and mission data
5. **Robinhood:** Leverages TimescaleDB for financial data analysis
6. **Comcast:** Utilizes Graphite for network monitoring and capacity planning
7. **Booking.com:** Employs Graphite and Grafana for system monitoring
8. **Cloudflare:** Uses their own TSDB called Fgprof for performance profiling
9. **eBay:** Utilizes OpenTSDB for various monitoring tasks
10. **Spotify:** Uses Prometheus for monitoring their microservices architecture

## Code Example: Inserting Data into InfluxDB

Here's a simple Python example of inserting data into InfluxDB:

```python
from influxdb import InfluxDBClient

# Connect to InfluxDB
client = InfluxDBClient(host='localhost', port=8086)
client.switch_database('mydb')

# Prepare the data point
json_body = [
    {
        "measurement": "cpu_load_short",
        "tags": {
            "host": "server01",
            "region": "us-west"
        },
        "time": "2009-11-10T23:00:00Z",
        "fields": {
            "value": 0.64
        }
    }
]

# Write the data
client.write_points(json_body)
```
