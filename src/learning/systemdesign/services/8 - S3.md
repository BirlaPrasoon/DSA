# Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)

## What is Amazon S3?

**Amazon S3** is a scalable object storage service provided by AWS. It is designed to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web. Amazon S3 offers high durability, availability, and security for data storage.

## Key Concepts

1. **Buckets**: Containers for storing objects. Each bucket has a unique name within AWS and can hold an unlimited number of objects.
2. **Objects**: The fundamental entities stored in S3, consisting of data, a key (name), and metadata.
3. **Regions**: S3 stores data in different geographical regions to optimize latency, minimize costs, and address regulatory requirements.

## Core Features

1. **Durability and Availability**: S3 offers 99.999999999% (11 9```s) durability and 99.99% availability of objects over a given year.
2. **Scalability**: Automatically scales to handle large amounts of data and requests.
3. **Security**: Provides features such as encryption, access control policies, and bucket policies to secure data.

## APIs and Operations

### 1. Amazon S3 Java SDK API

**Java API Operations**:
- `createBucket`: Creates a new bucket.
- `listBuckets`: Lists all the buckets owned by the authenticated sender of the request.
- `putObject`: Uploads an object to a bucket.
- `getObject`: Retrieves an object from a bucket.
- `deleteObject`: Deletes an object from a bucket.
- `listObjects`: Lists objects within a bucket.

**Example Code** (Java using AWS SDK):

```java
import com.amazonaws.services.s3.AmazonS3;
import com.amazonaws.services.s3.AmazonS3ClientBuilder;
import com.amazonaws.services.s3.model.PutObjectRequest;
import com.amazonaws.services.s3.model.GetObjectRequest;
import com.amazonaws.services.s3.model.DeleteObjectRequest;
import com.amazonaws.services.s3.model.ListObjectsV2Request;
import com.amazonaws.services.s3.model.ListObjectsV2Result;
import java.io.File;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStream;

public class S3Example {
public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
AmazonS3 s3Client = AmazonS3ClientBuilder.defaultClient();
String bucketName = "my-bucket";
String keyName = "my-file.txt";
String filePath = "path/to/local/file.txt";

        // Create a new bucket
        s3Client.createBucket(bucketName);

        // Upload a file to the bucket
        s3Client.putObject(new PutObjectRequest(bucketName, keyName, new File(filePath)));

        // Download the file
        InputStream objectData = s3Client.getObject(new GetObjectRequest(bucketName, keyName)).getObjectContent();
        byte[] buffer = new byte[1024];
        int bytesRead;
        while ((bytesRead = objectData.read(buffer)) != -1) {
            System.out.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);
        }
        objectData.close();

        // List objects in the bucket
        ListObjectsV2Request listObjectsRequest = new ListObjectsV2Request().withBucketName(bucketName);
        ListObjectsV2Result result = s3Client.listObjectsV2(listObjectsRequest);
        result.getObjectSummaries().forEach(s -> System.out.println("Object: " + s.getKey()));

        // Delete the object
        s3Client.deleteObject(new DeleteObjectRequest(bucketName, keyName));

        // Delete the bucket
        s3Client.deleteBucket(bucketName);
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

Amazon S3 provides a robust, scalable, and secure object storage solution. By understanding its key concepts and APIs, you can effectively manage and interact with your data stored in S3. The provided Java code examples demonstrate basic operations for interacting with S3, including bucket and object management.
