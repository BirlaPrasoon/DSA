# Distributed Systems Topics for SDE 3 Interviews

As an SDE 3, you should be well-versed in a variety of topics related to distributed systems. Here are key areas to focus on:

## 1. Distributed System Basics
- **Definitions and Terminology**: Understand basic concepts such as nodes, clusters, and scalability.
- **Types of Distributed Systems**: Differentiate between client-server, peer-to-peer, and microservices architectures.

## 2. Architectural Patterns
- **Microservices Architecture**: Understand how to design, deploy, and manage microservices.
- **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)**: Knowledge of service composition and orchestration.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Handling events, pub/sub patterns, and message brokers.

## 3. Consistency Models
- **CAP Theorem**: Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance.
- **ACID Transactions**: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability.
- **BASE Properties**: Basically Available, Soft state, Eventually consistent.

## 4. Data Replication and Sharding
- **Replication Strategies**: Master-slave, multi-master, leader-follower.
- **Sharding**: Partitioning data across nodes to manage load and scalability.

## 5. Fault Tolerance and Reliability
- **Redundancy**: Techniques to ensure data and service availability.
- **Failover Mechanisms**: Automatic recovery from failures.
- **Circuit Breakers**: Preventing cascading failures.

## 6. Consensus Algorithms
- **Paxos**: Understanding how Paxos achieves consensus in a distributed system.
- **Raft**: A simpler alternative to Paxos for achieving consensus.
- **Two-Phase Commit (2PC) and Three-Phase Commit (3PC)**: Protocols for ensuring atomicity of distributed transactions.

## 7. Scalability
- **Horizontal vs. Vertical Scaling**: Techniques to scale applications and databases.
- **Load Balancing**: Distributing workload across multiple servers.
- **Caching**: Strategies and tools for caching data to improve performance.

## 8. Distributed Storage Systems
- **Databases**: SQL vs. NoSQL databases, distributed databases, and their trade-offs.
- **File Systems**: Distributed file systems like HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System).

## 9. Network Protocols and Communication
- **REST vs. gRPC**: Protocols for inter-service communication.
- **Message Queues**: Understanding systems like Kafka, RabbitMQ, or SQS.
- **Service Discovery**: Techniques for locating services in a dynamic environment.

## 10. Security and Privacy
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Methods to secure distributed systems.
- **Data Encryption**: Protecting data in transit and at rest.
- **Network Security**: Techniques for securing communication between nodes.

## 11. Monitoring and Observability
- **Logging**: Strategies for logging in distributed systems.
- **Metrics and Monitoring**: Tools and techniques for monitoring system health and performance.
- **Tracing**: Distributed tracing for diagnosing issues and understanding request flows.

## 12. Design and Trade-offs
- **Design Patterns**: Common patterns used in distributed systems, such as retry, circuit breaker, and bulkhead.
- **Trade-offs**: Balancing consistency, availability, and partition tolerance based on system requirements.

## 13. Real-World Use Cases and Challenges
- **Case Studies**: Understanding how large companies like Google, Amazon, or Facebook handle distributed systems.
- **Performance Tuning**: Techniques for optimizing distributed systems for performance.

## Example Topics for Interview Questions
- How does the CAP theorem affect system design?
- Explain how you would design a distributed system for a high-traffic web application.
- What are the trade-offs between different consistency models?
- Describe how you would handle data replication and consistency in a distributed database.
- How do you ensure fault tolerance and recovery in a distributed system?

Familiarity with these topics will help you demonstrate a deep understanding of distributed systems and their challenges, making you a strong candidate for an SDE 3 position.
