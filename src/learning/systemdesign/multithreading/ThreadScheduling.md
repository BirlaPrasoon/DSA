# Thread Scheduling in Java

Thread scheduling is the process by which the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) decides the order and timing of thread execution. Understanding thread scheduling helps in writing efficient multi-threaded programs and optimizing performance.

## Key Concepts

### 1. **Thread Scheduling Basics**

- **Preemptive Scheduling:** Java uses a preemptive scheduling model where the operating system's thread scheduler decides which thread runs at any given time. The JVM relies on the underlying OS to perform this scheduling, which means Java threads are subject to the same scheduling policies as other system threads.
- **Thread Priority:** Java threads can be assigned different priority levels using `Thread.setPriority()`. Higher priority threads are generally given preference over lower priority threads. However, thread priorities are only a hint to the scheduler; the actual behavior depends on the JVM and OS.

### 2. **Thread States and Transitions**

- **New:** The thread is created but not yet started.
- **Runnable:** The thread is eligible for running but may not be currently executing. It waits for CPU time.
- **Running:** The thread is currently executing.
- **Blocked:** The thread is waiting to acquire a lock or resource.
- **Waiting:** The thread is waiting indefinitely for another thread to perform a specific action.
- **Timed Waiting:** The thread is waiting for a specified amount of time.
- **Terminated:** The thread has finished execution or has been terminated.

### 3. **Thread Scheduling Policies**

- **Round-Robin Scheduling:** Threads are given a fixed time slice (quantum) to execute. After the quantum expires, the scheduler moves to the next thread in the queue. This policy ensures fair distribution of CPU time among threads.
- **Priority-Based Scheduling:** Threads are scheduled based on their priority levels. Higher priority threads are given preference over lower priority ones. This approach can lead to starvation if higher priority threads continuously preempt lower priority ones.
- **Time-Slicing:** The CPU time is divided into small slices or time quanta. Each thread gets a turn to execute for a short duration before the scheduler switches to another thread. This method ensures responsiveness and fairness in thread execution.

### 4. **Thread Scheduling in Java**

- **Thread Priority:** Java provides thread priorities via the `Thread` class. You can set thread priorities using `Thread.setPriority(int priority)` with values ranging from `Thread.MIN_PRIORITY` (1) to `Thread.MAX_PRIORITY` (10). The default priority is `Thread.NORM_PRIORITY` (5).

  Example:

```java
    Thread t = new Thread();
    t.setPriority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY);
```

- **Thread Scheduling Hints:** Although Java allows you to set thread priorities, the actual scheduling behavior depends on the JVM and the underlying operating system. Java thread priorities are primarily a hint to the JVM, which may not enforce strict adherence.

- **Yielding:** The `Thread.yield()` method allows a thread to voluntarily relinquish the CPU, giving other threads a chance to run. It is used to suggest to the scheduler that the current thread is willing to yield its remaining time slice.

  Example:

```java
  Thread.yield();
```

- **Sleeping:** The `Thread.sleep(long millis)` method pauses the execution of the current thread for a specified amount of time. It is useful for creating delays or managing timing between thread executions.

  Example:

```java
  try {
    Thread.sleep(1000); // Sleep for 1 second
  } catch (InterruptedException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
  }
```

### 5. **Thread Scheduling Considerations**

- **Fairness vs. Performance:** High-priority threads may starve low-priority threads if not managed properly. Balancing fairness and performance is crucial for optimal thread scheduling.
- **Deadlock Prevention:** Proper thread scheduling helps avoid deadlocks where two or more threads are waiting indefinitely for resources held by each other.

## Summary

Thread scheduling in Java involves managing thread execution order and timing through various policies and techniques. Understanding how Java handles thread scheduling helps in writing efficient, responsive, and fair multi-threaded applications. Key factors include thread priorities, scheduling policies, and methods like `yield()` and `sleep()` that influence thread behavior.
