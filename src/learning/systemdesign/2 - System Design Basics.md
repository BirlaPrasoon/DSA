# System Design Basics

System design is crucial for creating robust, scalable, and efficient systems. Understanding the basics of system design will help you tackle complex design problems and make informed decisions about architecture and implementation. Here’s an in-depth look at some fundamental concepts in system design:

## 1. Scalability

**Scalability** refers to the ability of a system to handle an increasing amount of load or demand by adding resources. Scalability can be achieved in two primary ways:

- **Vertical Scaling**: Also known as "scaling up," this involves adding more power (CPU, RAM, etc.) to a single server. While vertical scaling can be simpler to implement, it has limitations and can be expensive. For example:
  ```java
  // Example: Increasing server resources
  Server server = new Server();
  server.increaseCPU(8); // Adding more CPU cores
  server.increaseRAM(32); // Adding more RAM
  ```

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Also known as "scaling out," this involves adding more servers to handle increased load. It often requires more complex system design, including load balancing and distributed data management. For example:
  ```java
  // Example: Adding more servers
  List<Server> servers = Arrays.asList(new Server(), new Server(), new Server());
  LoadBalancer loadBalancer = new LoadBalancer(servers);
  ```

## 2. Availability

**Availability** is the measure of a system’s operational performance and uptime. Designing for high availability means ensuring that the system is operational and accessible even in the event of hardware failures, network issues, or other disruptions. Key techniques include:

- **Redundancy**: Having multiple instances of critical components (e.g., servers, databases) to ensure that failure in one does not affect the overall system. For example:
  ```java
  // Example: Redundant servers
  List<Server> primaryServers = Arrays.asList(new Server(), new Server());
  List<Server> backupServers = Arrays.asList(new Server(), new Server());
  ```

- **Failover Mechanisms**: Automatically switching to backup systems when a primary system fails. For example:
  ```java
  // Example: Failover mechanism
  Server primaryServer = new Server();
  Server backupServer = new Server();
  if (!primaryServer.isAvailable()) {
  primaryServer = backupServer;
  }
  ```

## 3. Reliability

**Reliability** refers to the system’s ability to consistently perform its intended functions without failure. To enhance reliability, you can use techniques like:

- **Health Checks**: Regularly monitoring the health of servers and services to ensure they are functioning correctly. For example:
  ```java
  // Example: Health check
  public boolean isHealthy(Server server) {
  // Perform health checks
  return server.checkStatus() == Status.OK;
  }
  ```

- **Graceful Degradation**: Designing systems to maintain limited functionality even when some components fail. For example:
  ```java
  // Example: Graceful degradation
  if (!service.isAvailable()) {
  return fallbackService.getFallbackData();
  }
  ```

Understanding these concepts will provide a solid foundation for designing systems that can efficiently handle increasing load, remain available during failures, and operate reliably under various conditions.
